As an intern in adnexio, I was involved in their mobile development team on developing an in-house app v1.0 using react native framework (Barebone). 


During the process, I gained the knowledge on building and developing react native app from scratch until reaching production stage within 3 months of my internship period. The app was also successfully launch and published in google play store for end-users to give an hand-ons experience in our app. The app developed serves as a platform for jobseekers and job recruiters to connect and allowing jobseekers to find job vacancy easily. 



The app also utilizes machine learning algorithms on matching suitable job positions for job seekers.
Since the mobile team includes only 2 person (including myself). My responsibilites were helping them building up the front end UIs, managing android configurations, debugging bugs, resolving configuration issues and connecting the app to backend service via APIs.
